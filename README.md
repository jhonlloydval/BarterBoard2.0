## **How It Works**  

### ![Register and Login](images/7.png)  
1. **Register and Login**:  
   Users create an account or log in to access BarterBoard features. The user database, including credentials and profile information, is securely stored in **barterboard.db** using MySQL.

### ![BarterBoard](images/2.png)  
2. **BarterBoard**:  
   The BarterBoard displays all available items for trade, each with detailed information including the listing ID, username of the lister, item name, description, quantity, location, and the desired item for trade. A **Bargain** option lets users propose a trade by selecting an item and sending a proposal to the listing owner.

### ![BarterBoard](images/3.png)  
3. **Add Listing**:  
   Users can add new listings by providing key details such as the item name, description, quantity, location, and the item they wish to receive in exchange. Each listing becomes available for others to view and bargain for on the BarterBoard.

### ![BarterBoard](images/4.png)  
4. **View Listing**:  
   Users can check their own listings to see all the items they have posted for trade. This section also allows them to edit or remove listing details as needed, keeping their profile updated and relevant.

### ![BarterBoard](images/5.png)  
5. **Listing Update**:  
   Users are notified when a proposal is received for one of their listings. They can choose to **accept**, **reject**, or **skip** the proposal. Accepted proposals move to the transaction phase, while rejected proposals are removed from the user's queue.

### ![BarterBoard](images/6.png)
6. **Transaction**:  
   This section displays a history of all completed exchanges, providing users with a clear record of their contributions and trades. It helps users track their activity and fosters trust within the community.

# **About the Developer**
Hello! I am Jhon Lloyd, a first-year computer science student and the developer of BarterBoard. BarterBoard is actually the final project for my Computer Programming class under Sir Alexander Maralit. I am currently working my way toward mastering Python, and this project has given me the boost I was aiming for. I worked on this project for 4 days, and I encountered many debugging sessions since I am new to MySQL. 

In today’s era, online shopping has greatly overshadowed many local traditions, from buying in Divisoria to doing the traditional barter. So, I decided to create a console project for Barter while integrating my knowledge of computer programming. I have developed and learned a lot of concepts while working on this project, from practicing Object-Oriented Programming to learning about MySQL. It was complicated at first, and I asked a lot of questions online, but I grasped the syntax along the way.

I couldn’t imagine how many times I logged into the program—probably close to a thousand, and I’m not even exaggerating. It was very challenging, yet I am relieved to have completed the project before the end of 2024. Everything is not yet final; there are still a lot of things I am not satisfied with, so I am looking forward to coding this project again.

I'd like to thank a fellow computer science student and friend, Denrei, created a project called HearDrop, which played a significant role in inspiring this work.

Thank you for checking out my project! I am very open to suggestions. This project is not just a task I needed to submit for our final project, but a testament that I am slowly learning day by day and serves as a baby step toward my goal of becoming a software engineer someday.

Best regards, 
**Jhon Lloyd Valencia**
